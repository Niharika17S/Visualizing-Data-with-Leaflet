#  Visualizing Data with Leaflet

![2-BasicMap](Images/2-BasicMap.png)

   Created a map using Leaflet that plots world wide earthquakes based on longitude and latitude from USGS dataset.
   * baseMaps object holds the tile layers and overlayMaps holds the earthquake dataset.  
   * Here the data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
   * Popups provides additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
   * Legend provides context of the map data.
